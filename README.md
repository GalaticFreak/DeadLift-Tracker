# 🏋️‍♂️ Deadlift Tracker: Posture Evaluation using Pose Estimation and Machine Learning

This project evaluates a user's deadlift form using real-time pose estimation and machine learning classification. 
By analyzing joint angles captured via MediaPipe, the system classifies posture as either **"Good"** or **"Bad"**, providing instant feedback for corrective training.
